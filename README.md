Typescript rest api using typeorm.

This was my first time using typescript and typeorm so i did a simple crud/ rest api just to learn the basics.

since i have a bit of experience with rest api's, i just followed some forums and the typeorm documentation while doing it.

frameworks i used while doing this project: node, express, typescript, typeorm, .env and postman.
